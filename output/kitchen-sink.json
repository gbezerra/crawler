If tequila isn\u2019t your thing, try rye in its place. If you don\u2019t have honey, make a two-to-one with maple syrup. Can\u2019t have beer? Cider would taste great. If it sounds like it\u2019ll taste good, chances are it will.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c3 Great Batched Cocktails for Your Next Party.\u201d\n\nAdd all the ingredients and 9 oz water into a large container and stir. Taste for balance.\n\nFunnel into bottles, cap the bottles, and chill with the beer until game time.\n\nTo serve, fill a large bowl with ice, and pour the batch over the ice.\n\nTop with beer to taste.\n\nGarnish with orange peels, orange and lemon wheels, and grated nutmeg.\n\nTo serve, pour into a rocks glass over ice, and top with more beer.\n\n*Honey syrup: Add 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup water to a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until blended. Strain into a jar and seal tightly with a lid. Will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/m8wA6pRcHKUsw5M-c_pZ_xtcpQk=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__08__31122044__3-Prebatched-Cocktails-for-your-Football-Parties-kitchen-sink-720x720-slideshow-5c7298b5fe6f40f9a1ddedf2608c90d5.jpg", "authorName": "Sean Hoard", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
