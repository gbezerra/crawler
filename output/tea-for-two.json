It includes half a cup of peach schnapps, where it sweetens and adds fruitiness to Jamaican rum and cognac. \u201cPeach schnapps pairs best with fruit-forward spirits,\u201d she says. \u201cVodkas won\u2019t fight the flavors of [it], but it\u2019s not as dimensioned and wouldn\u2019t be my first choice.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cWhat the #$@! Do I Do with This? Peach Schnapps.
