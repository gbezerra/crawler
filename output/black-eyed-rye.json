As an added bonus, I use rye from a Maryland company, Sagamore Spirit. Baltimore is affectionately called Charm City, built on the hard work of blue-collar workers and tough love, which is the same way our football team competes every week. The purple color of the cocktail ties into the team colors of purple and black, too.\u201d\n\nAdd all of the ingredients except the ginger beer to a shaker with ice, and shake vigorously for 25 seconds.\n\nDouble-strain into a highball glass filled with ice, and top off with the ginger beer.\n\nGarnish with a mint sprig and three blackberries.\n\n*Blackberry mint syrup: Add 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water to a small saucepan over medium heat.
