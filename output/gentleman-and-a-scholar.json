He takes ingredients that would typically be thrown away\u2014unused lime wheels, overflowing beer, and more\u2014and adds them to house-made ingredients like strawberry beer syrup and aquafaba. The resulting cocktail is not just an eco-friendly take on the Whiskey Sour; it\u2019s delicious enough to earn him a trip to the finals in the Gentleman Jack Whiskey Sour Classic.\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker and dry-shake (no ice) for 30-45 seconds.\n\nAdd ice and shake again for another 20-30 seconds.\n\nDouble-strain into a cocktail glass and let sit for 5-10 seconds so the whip can gain form.\n\nMist with the bitters twice.\n\nGarnish with a dehydrated lemon wheel.\n\n*Strawberry beer syrup: Add 1 qt beer, 1 qt strawberry pure\u00e9 and 1/2 to 1 cup sugar (preferably palm sugar) to a pot. Heat over stove until it\u2019s reduced to 1 1/2 qts syrup.\n\n**Aquafaba: Take the water used to cook white legumes for hummus and boil until it\u2019s reduced by half. Remove from heat and place into a container and refrigerate.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/24mgQ8J3pSo3EtldYDMLdZdL1FM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__09__04110811__gentleman-jack-whiskey-sour_gentleman-scholar_720x720-7c37f1331b3b423384243fb5e35b5a58.jpg", "authorName": "Ian McLaughlin", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
