The problem with so many of today\u2019s autumnal cocktails is that they ignore one important fact: Fall can be damn balmy. Our bourbon slushie bridges the seasons with apple cider, cinnamon-vanilla syrup and a heaping scoop of ice to help stave off Indian summer.\n\nCombine all the ingredients into a blender with cubed ice and blend until smooth.\n\nPour into a Moscow Mule mug.\n\nGarnish with an apple slice and a cinnamon stick.\n\n*Cinnamon-vanilla syrup: In a saucepan, bring 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup turbinado sugar to a boil. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Let sit for 10 minutes. Strain into a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 1 month.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/GeXy8aKMws_UiiTigjCyKvsOE7k=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__09__20085158__Bourbon-Cider-Slushie-720x720-article-f5ce0d12ce6f410abe685883614ef7f1.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
