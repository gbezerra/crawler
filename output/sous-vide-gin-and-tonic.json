Schaller at Sterling, Va.\u2019s Culinary Research & Education Academy (CREA), Cuisine Solutions\u2019 research arm, starts with a sous vide tonic syrup. Keeping infusions under 185\u00b0F is crucial, says Schaller. \u201cThis is the temperature at which the flavor of the volatile oils will change on the fruit and thicken the product,\u201d she says. Starting with room temperature ingredients will also help with a more rapid transfer of flavors, according to Schaller.\n\nAdd the gin to a Highball glass with ice.\n\nTop with the tonic water.\n\nGarnish with a lime wedge.\n\n*Sous vide tonic water: Add 4 cups water, 4 tsp powdered cinchona bark, 1 cup lemongrass, 1 roughly chopped lemon (with zest added and juiced), 1 roughly cut lime (with zest added and juiced), 1 roughly chopped orange (with zest added and juiced, 1 grapefruit (with zest added and juiced), 1 tsp allspice berries, 1/4 cup citric acid, 1/4 cup salt and half of 3/4 cup agave syrup to a sous vide bag.
