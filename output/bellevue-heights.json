Playing delicately with gin and fino sherry, the drink unfolds with subtle nutty, creamy, fruity, tannic and dry notes from a house-made pistachio white tea syrup and banana bitters.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c11 Gin Cocktails to Drink in Bars Now.\u201d\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker with 1 cube of ice, and shake.\n\nDouble-strain into a coupe.\n\nGarnish with a stripe of Angostura bitters.\n\n*Pistachio white tea syrup: Combine 50 grams of crushed pistachios with 500 mL sugar and 500 mL water in a pot. Bring to a boil at medium heat, then reduce to low heat and let boil for 10 minutes. Strain out solids. Combine the syrup with Chinese white needle tea (1 oz of tea per 1 L of syrup) for 1 minute. Strain through a coffee filter.
