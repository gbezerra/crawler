This lovely red-hued cocktail takes the bitterness of Campari and mellows it out with a little honey syrup and sweet blood orange. It gets a little sparkle from soda water and proves perfectly refreshing on hot day or as an after-dinner treat.\n\nAdd all the ingredients to a highball glass with ice, and stir gently.\n\nGarnish with an orange chip.\n\n*Honey syrup: Add .5 cup honey and .5 cup water to a small saucepan over medium heat. (You can experiment and decide how much of a honey flavor you want in your syrup. The more honey you use, the thicker the syrup and stronger in flavor it will be.) Stir until blended. Strain into a jar and seal tightly with a lid. Will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/lN3DpdIoc95hJAPBPt-2Ieoiay8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__01__30141023__Make-It-Count-720x720-recipe-b2033942d9714401b81f57ff16d6e017.jpg", "authorName": "Pamela Wiznitzer", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
