Add the squash, 1/4 cup of maple syrup and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Spread the squash on a baking sheet and bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until soft. Allow to cool. In a large Mason jar, combine the squash with 1 750mL bottle of bourbon (like Buffalo Trace), and set the empty bottle aside until later. Cover tightly and allow it to infuse for two to three weeks. Strain the bourbon, funnel back into the empty bottle (be sure to label the bottle), and cap tightly. The infused bourbon should keep for five to seven days.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/wZpJQwHzNZ4ahfqJNVuLKY0PPRg=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__10__13095839__The-Squash-Cocktail-That-Beats-the-Pumpkin-Spice-Latte-at-Its-Own-Game-720x720-article-9d0ed44973af447fa31519427ed21b3a.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
