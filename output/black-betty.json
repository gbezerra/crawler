Once the sugar has dissolved, add the blended sesame seeds to the saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then remove from heat and cool for 3 hours.

Spread the pulp onto a tray, and place the tray in a dehydrator or oven at 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the pulp is completely dry, add it to a spice grinder or blender with 1/2 cup white sugar, then blitz into a fine powder.
