The Grave Digger is a simple twist on a Spanish Coffee with one spooky exception: It\u2019s topped with crushed Oreo cookies and a tiny shovel to resemble a freshly dug grave\u2014a nifty little trick we picked up from cocktail influencer Katie Stryjewski, aka @garnish_girl.\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into a coupe.\n\nTop with whipped cream and crushed Oreo cookies (discarding cream in center).\n\n*Vanilla-infused brandy: Cut 2 fresh vanilla pods lengthwise and place into a 750 mL bottle of brandy.
