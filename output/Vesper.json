The cocktail was invented by none other than Bond author Ian Fleming. The Vesper first appeared in his book \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d which was published in 1953 and gets its name from fictional double agent Vesper Lynd.\n\nWhen Bond orders the Vesper, it comes with strict instructions that must be followed by any who make it: \u201cThree measures of Gordon\u2019s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it\u2019s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?\u201d\n\nWith respect to 007, shaking a Vesper can result in an overly diluted drink. The golden rule is to always stir a spirit-only drink. And we see no reason to change that here.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir (or, if preparing the Bond way, shake).\n\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\n\nTwist a slice of lemon peel over the drink, rub along the rim of the glass, and drop it in.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/8W80upJr4d_MuoHwRw-OxIKR0xE=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__01__29145254__vesper-720x720-recipe-a8733cdfcfc1495687f1073004e04950.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 199, "avgRating": 4.5}
