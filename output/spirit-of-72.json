Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes, tasting periodically until reaching desired level of spiciness. Remove from heat and skim off and discard jalape\u00f1o slices. Cool to room temperature before using. Will keep in the refrigerator for about 1 month.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/Exy5XOLCiGqq-LLOayNRw1XC0uw=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__12__02102908__spirit-72-720x720-recipe-f1cfb4c25563403b8457f395864fe452.jpg", "authorName": "Seth Weinberg", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
