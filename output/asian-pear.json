Orson Salicetti, at New York City\u2019s Lumos, uses it in this cocktail for its floral, lightly sweet notes, which complement the pear juice and liqueur. With the inclusion of agave and lime, this is essentially a sour with some additional components.\n\nAdd all of the ingredients to a shaker with ice, and shake until chilled.\n\nStrain into a coupe glass, and garnish with a fresh sage leaf.\n\n*Lumos spice elixir: Infuse 1 part allspice, clove and cinnamon separately in 3 parts baijiu. After 3 weeks, strain and taste each infusion, then combine the infusions. Transfer to a dropper and use by single drops as it is very powerful.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/lKkmfitwsV4nq3WgcTENEhdzQoY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__12__22081033__Asian-Pear-720x720-recipe-320dd8124ef24e3da2fe13d5053c38b1.jpg", "authorName": "Orson Salicetti", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
