The staple cocktail sweetener more than earns its name, consisting, simply, of equal-parts granulated sugar and water. From there, the variations are endless. Like your sweetener sweeter? Up the ratio to two to one, sugar to water. Looking to add a little zip to your Paloma or oomph to your Old Fashioned? Steep a couple of jalape\u00f1o slices or cinnamon sticks.\n\nThe best part? Your homemade simple syrup, once sealed and refrigerated, can live a happy, productive life for up to a month. That\u2019s 30 days shaking, stirring, blending and drinking your own homemade cocktails. Now doesn\u2019t that sound sweet?\n\nAdd the sugar and water to a small saucepan over medium heat.\n\nStir until sugar is dissolved.\n\nLet cool, then pour into a glass jar and seal tightly with a lid.\n\nSimple syrup will keep, refrigerated, for about one month.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/yedIuYVJTLRBmYwnBxVwl4ZnvIA=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__08__06122918__simple-syrup-720x720-recipe-1-d11c560131424195bb293100f23b3e5d.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 146, "avgRating": 4.5}
