Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 1/4 cups water in a pot over medium heat, and stir until sugar dissolves completely. Boil the syrup for 3 minutes, then add in the ground pistachios. Turn the heat down to low, and simmer for another 3 minutes, then slowly increase the temperature to medium high. Just before it starts to boil, remove it from the heat and cover with a lid. Allow the covered nut mixture to infuse for 3 to 8 hours. Strain it through 2 layers of cheesecloth, discarding the ground hazelnuts for another use. Stir 1/2 tsp orange flower water and 1 oz vodka into the syrup. Use a small funnel to portion the orgeat into bottles or a jar. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.", "imageURL": "//cdn.liquor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/27104838/lucybeaugard-11.jpg"}
