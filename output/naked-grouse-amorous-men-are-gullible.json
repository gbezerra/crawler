The result is a complex recipe that won the Philadelphia bartender the Naked Grouse Cocktail Competition.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass.\n\n*Shiitake-infused Naked Grouse scotch whisky: Add 3 oz dried shiitake mushrooms to a 750mL bottle of Naked Grouse scotch. Make sure mushrooms are fully submerged and let sit for 3 days. Strain liquid into another container. Collect rehydrated mushrooms in cheesecloth and squeeze out excess scotch. Discard mushrooms, store infusion in fridge.\n\n**Dashi syrup: Combine 1 qt water, 24 g dried sea kelp and 15 g bonito flakes in a pot and bring to a boil. Let simmer at medium heat for 7 minutes. Add 1 qt sugar and stir until combined. Remove from heat and let cool. Strain out sea kelp before storing.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/8Xy8IzaqXtILFiATeEEPwMnEqbM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__07__27104831__tednghiemgrousecocktail-54-4b9349b762f6463bb764ebc8ee41366d.jpg", "authorName": "Miranda Helck", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
