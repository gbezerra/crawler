From this, bartender Whitney Neal envisioned a cocktail using the savory-sweet blend of spices like sumac, sesame and thyme for a fresh take on a Paloma. Her version mixes Patr\u00f3n silver tequila with fresh grapefruit juice and an ounce of za'atar simple syrup, served over ice with a lime wheel garnish. Sip on its own or enjoy it with grilled meat.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a Collins glass over fresh ice.\n\nGarnish with a lime wheel.\n\nServe with a straw.\n\nZa\u2019atar simple syrup: Add 2 cups sugar and 2 cups water to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Add 1/4 cup za\u2019atar while syrup is still hot to let spices steep. Let sit for at least 3 hours. Strain out sesame seeds and refrigerate. Good for up to 1 month.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/SYEK9M70K1IoSF-NB9MfWmqxCb4=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__09__04082654__12-Cocktails-That-Use-Middle-Eastern-Ingredients-sitti-zaatar-paloma-720x720-slideshow-eca712876c6147f58834cd80c95dedda.jpg", "authorName": "Whitney Neal", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
