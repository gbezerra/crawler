Sean Hogan, a bartender at the resort\u2019s Lobby Lounge, substituted the usual maple syrup for ginger and honey, whose flavors better meld with the fresh flavor of cucumber. He uses a Zumex centrifugal juicer to extract the juice and recommends using it as soon as possible. \u201cLemon and lime juices are best within about four hours of pressing, and cucumber is viable for about 12 hours.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cCheat a Little During Dry January with These 3 Pressed Juice Cocktails.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker and dry-shake (without ice) until frothy.\n\nAdd ice and shake again until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into a cocktail glass.\n\nGarnish with a sprinkle of ground cayenne.\n\n*Ginger syrup: Bring 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water to boil in small saucepan. Add 4 oz peeled ginger cut into thin rounds (about a 10-inch long piece). Remove from heat and allow to steep for 30 minutes, then strain out solids.
