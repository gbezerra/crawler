You may have seen the likes of cucumber, lime and ginger with vodka before, but the Green Eyes goes a new direction with sesame-oil-washed vodka. The drink is still green and garden-fresh but with a subtle nutty silkiness.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c11 Vodka Cocktails to Drink in Bars Now.\u201d\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass.\n\nGarnish with a cucumber wheel.\n\n*Sesame-infused vodka: Combine 1/2 cup sesame oil and 3 1/2 cups vodka and shake, then let infuse for 72 hours at room temperature. Place in freezer for 24 hours. Oil will solidify, allowing to strain it out. Pass through a fine strainer before it thaws.\n\n**Cucumber ginger syrup: Juice 4 cups thinly sliced cucumber and strain. In a medium pot, combine 2 cups thinly sliced ginger, 4 cups sugar and 2 cups water, and bring to a boil. Once it boils, take off of burner and let cool to room temperature. Strain out ginger pieces, and mix in cucumber juice. Bottle and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/A7pZaK47jkIEnw-lCgckSXT-zKs=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__06__06082205__11-Vodka-Cocktails-to-Drink-Bars-Now-rich-table-green-eyes-720x720-slideshow-659c47a8ca3445e08e6069091ee0b981.jpg", "authorName": "Tommy Quimby", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
