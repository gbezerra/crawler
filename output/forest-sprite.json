Using a floral juniper-forward gin works well with heavy pine syrup, which you can make yourself by harvesting new fronds from that tree outside. Drink this after tromping through the woods, by the fire or whenever you want a winter drink that's also refreshing.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c6 Gin Drinks Perfect for Sipping by the Fireplace.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients except the seltzer into a mixing glass with ice and stir well.\n\nStrain into a Collins glass over ice.\n\nTop with the seltzer and bitters.\n\nGarnish with a lemon twist and pine sprig.\n\n*Pine syrup: In a medium pot, add 1/4 cup roughly chopped conifer tips to 1 cup boiling water and 1 cup granulated sugar.
