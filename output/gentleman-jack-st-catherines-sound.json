He uses Jerry Thomas\u2019 classic sour template from 1862. In 1922, London barman Robert Vermeire wrote, \u201cA few drops of egg improves all sours.\u201d Law followed this suggestion by milk-washing his house-made sour mix. That ingredient also reflects major bartending trends from the past 40 years. He uses freshly squeezed juice\u2014a practice that became common in cocktail bars in the 1990s\u2014to make a sour mix, which was a staple of the 1980s. But you don\u2019t need to know any of the history to appreciate the subtle and delicious St. Catherine\u2019s Sound.\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker with 3 2-inch ice cubes and shake 6-10 times to chill and aerate the cocktail with minimal dilution.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.\n\nGarnish with a dehydrated strawberry.\n\n*Acid-adjusted sour mix (milk-washed): Create an oleo with 10 grapefruit peels, 10 lemon peels and 4 orange peels and let it sit overnight. Combine the oleo with 9 oz grapefruit juice, 9 oz lemon juice and 4 1/2 oz orange juice until sugar dissolves. Bring 18 oz whole milk to a boil and slowly pour into sour mixture. Allow to sit and curdle for no less than 6 hours. Lastly, pour mixture through a mesh strainer several times (use the same milk-curdle-filled strainer) until mixture is relatively clear.
