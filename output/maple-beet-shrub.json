From there, your imagination can run wild. Typically some variety of sugar does the heavy lifting, but here maple syrup offers a perfect hit of character and complexity. And although the beets maybe seem like an odd or unnecessary addition, they actually keep the sweetness in check with a welcome earthiness.\n\nOnce your shrub is ready (the longer you let it sit, the better), it\u2019s a fantastic mixer in a variety of cocktails, including these three favorites: the Shrub Julep, the Shrubarita and the G.C.S.\n\nPeel the beets - cut each into eight wedges, and add to a 1-quart jar along with the ginger, mustard seeds and bay leaf.\n\nIn a saucepan, combine the vinegar, maple syrup and salt with 1 cup of water. Stir to combine and bring to a boil over medium heat. Pour enough liquid into the prepared jar to cover the beets and let cool to room temperature.\n\nRefrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 2 weeks, shaking the jar every few days to distribute the flavors. Makes 1 quart.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/1eL7iOw8IRi2No4ouotcTYs15Tg=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__04__12212901__maple-beet-shrub-720x720-recipe-eb0ad5f6584c466f815afd0063fc9cae.jpg", "authorName": "Casey Elsass", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
