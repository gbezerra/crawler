The citrusy cocktail for a crowd perfectly combines the whimsy of sherbet we all know and love from childhood with the adult effervescence of a weekend morning Mimosa. The result is simple yet brilliant.\n\nServes 8-10.\n\nIn a large punch bowl, gently stir together the Champagne, orange juice and ginger ale.\n\nAdd the orange sherbet in generous scoops. The sherbet will slowly melt into the punch.\n\nLadle into rocks glasses (which are easier to ladle into than Champagne flutes).", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/FQS4vkErIPkR9UvIaAVp98q-5ko=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__03__01125737__Orange-Sherbet-Mimosa-Punch-720x720-recipe-47f55eda6abf44f994c8eeec0f2faa99.jpg", "authorName": "Joy Wilson", "reviewCount": 10, "avgRating": 4.5}
