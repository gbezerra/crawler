It was a substitution that launched a thousand riffs.\n\nIn its hundred-year history, few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved Negroni. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint.\n\nBut how do you mix the perfect version? Start by selecting the right base materials. The key to a great Negroni is finding a gin-vermouth pairing that complements, rather than overpowers, the bitter, bold flavors of Campari. Once you zero in on a winning trio, write it down, memorize it, and request it at your favorite bar. You\u2019ll make the count proud.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice, and stir until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass filled with large ice cubes.\n\nGarnish with an orange peel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/fPYdcwiLEH3A_7UkZF9erYYPHWk=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__05__08110806__negroni-720x720-recipe-7c1b747a616f4659af4008d025ab55df.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 135, "avgRating": 4.5}
