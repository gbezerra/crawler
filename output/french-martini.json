The primary spirit is vodka, though sometimes rum is used instead.\n\nThis recipe was created by venerable bartender Allen Katz and uses cr\u00e8me de cassis liqueur in lieu of Chambord. This imparts a deeper flavor from the currants that are a bit less sweet than raspberries. So this French Martini tends to be a little more spirit-forward and complex.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nFine-strain into a chilled cocktail glass.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/phRXyaAGyktS5uQwxLMwqCaZ5-g=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__01__29145229__french-martini-720x720-recipe-8a78cbe67c184381ac871e9ad6d5635a.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 26, "avgRating": 4.0}
