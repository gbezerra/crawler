The drink at Attaboy used muddled strawberries, but to lessen the prep time and reduce spent fruit waste, Elder makes a strawberry cordial, which combines with lemon juice, gentian, gin and pineau. The drink takes a garnish of fresh basil for extra aromatics.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c5 Great Cocktails Made with the Boozy Fortified Wine Pineau de Charentes.\u201d\n\nIn a double rocks glass, add the strawberry cordial, then the lemon juice and then the booze.\n\nAdd 1/2 scoop pellet ice, and gently stir.\n\nAdd more pellet ice to top off the glass, and shape into a rounded crown peaking just above the rim.\n\nGarnish with a basil sprig.\n\n*Strawberry cordial: In a quart container, cover 1 qt strawberries in 1 pint granulated sugar, and let rest overnight at room temperature. Turn the container occasionally to facilitate the extraction process. After 1 day, there should be a good amount of translucent, red liquid. Strain the liquid off, and discard excess sugar and berries.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/NP0ioBOAJ1y2qRdD178vqO34jyE=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__09__20151751__eddy-aquarelle-720x720-recipe-635178299bc04d758bdd0a72a7cc2d34.jpg", "authorName": "Brian Elder", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
