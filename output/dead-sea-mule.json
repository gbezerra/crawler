He makes a house-made grenadine eschewing the rosewater, which he says doesn\u2019t play well in the drink. Instead, Nemcik uses a smaller amount of sugar to retain the tart flavor of the pomegranate juice. It\u2019s all balanced out by the sweeter, more ginger-forward profile of Fever-Tree ginger beer.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c3 Ginger Beer Cocktails to Spice Up Your Holidays.\u201d\n\nAdd mezcal, lime juice and grenadine into a Collins glass with ice.\n\nTop with ginger beer.\n\nGarnish with mint sprig and 2 skewered pieces of candied ginger.\n\n*Grenadine: Heat mix of pomegranate juice and cane sugar in 3:2 ratio by weight just below boiling.
