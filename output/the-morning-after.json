Cognac gains subtle bitter and earthy layers from amaro and coffee liqueur. Look for chile spice, earthiness and chocolate undertones from chile liqueur, cold-brew coffee and chocolate bitters.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c11 Holiday Cocktails to Drink in Bars Now.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake briefly to chill.\n\nStrain into a double rocks glass over a large ice cube.\n\nGarnish with a large fresh mint leaf.\n\n*Use your favorite bottled cold-brew coffee or make yourself by soaking 140 g ground coffee beans in a coffee filter and 32 oz water for 12 hours. After steeping, remove grounds in coffee filter.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/xY3dvdwkrh0PUg6NJqkpBqFJ4ms=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__12__19123739__The-Barrow-House-Photo-Credit-Dominique-Marinzulich_article-recipe_720x720-d39ad0bdab89421692dedff36fd568f3.jpg", "authorName": "Virginia Miller", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
