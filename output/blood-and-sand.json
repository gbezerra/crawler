The recipe first appeared in 1930 in \"The Savoy Cocktail Book\" by Harry Craddock and has become a mainstay on bar menus ever since.\n\nIt gets its name from a 1922 bullfighter movie and points to its ingredients: The \u201cblood\u201d represents Heering cherry liqueur, and the \u201csand\u201d is for the orange juice.\n\nThe key to the cocktail is to use a smooth scotch that\u2019s not too smoky and freshly squeezed orange juice. So forget about your Islay scotches (for now), and avoid that carton of OJ in the fridge.\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass.\n\nGarnish with an orange peel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/7DMK77eW2TrbOiFZQtE6pFgNao8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__09__27104034__11-Scotch-Cocktails-to-Make-Right-Now-blood-and-sand-720x720-recipe-1e61cd5259614d56808081f58791a78a.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 7, "avgRating": 4.5}
