Combining orange juice and vodka in a highball glass is about as easy as a cocktail gets and creates a base that\u2019s ripe for experimentation.\n\nThe Screwdriver is a classic drink that has been designated an International Bartender Association official cocktail. The history of the Screwdriver is somewhat debatable, even though mention of it in literature goes back to 1949. Some claim that the drink was first made popular by American aviators. Another origin story claims that it was made popular by American oil workers who dubbed the drink the Screwdriver because they mixed it first with a screwdriver when a spoon was not on hand.\n\nMake this version of the classic Screwdriver next time you\u2019re hosting a brunch or just need a pick-me-up, and rediscover why this is an essential part of any cocktail toolbelt.\n\nAdd the vodka into a highball glass over ice.\n\nTop with the orange juice.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/ldH_3WUdngHXOhMD-g0dZPLYDH8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__11__06162348__screwdrvier-720x720-recipe-23e0c0ac47334f108e4fa00b34b7f5bf.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 18, "avgRating": 4.5}
