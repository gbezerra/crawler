The enzyme helps break down the fruit\u2019s pectin, which is a naturally occurring starch. When each solution is run through a centrifuge, the banana solids compress at the bottom of the device, leaving a crystal-clear liquid on top.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cClear Your Mind.
