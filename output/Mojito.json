The origins of the drink can be traced back to Cuba and the 16th-century Cuban cocktail El Draque, named for Sir Francis Drake.\n\nAppropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (derived from cane juice) are mixed with soda water to create a refreshing classic cocktail.\n\nThe Mojito is traditionally served over ice in a highball glass and often associated with summer. Like your cocktails with literary references? You\u2019re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway.\n\nWhile the Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, the end result is a delicious, refreshing cocktail that can be enjoyed any time of the year.\n\nLightly muddle the mint in a shaker.\n\nAdd the rum, lime juice, simple syrup and ice and give it a brief shake.\n\nStrain into a highball glass over fresh ice.\n\nTop with the club soda.\n\nGarnish with a mint sprig and lime wheel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/zFgjteKZhwn3uaUptddEP6W8qA8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__09__04153106__mojito-720x720-recipe-a55b114fc99c4a64b38c9ef6d1660e20.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 60, "avgRating": 4.5}
