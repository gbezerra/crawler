Add the cherries.\n\nUsing the slotted spoon, stir the cherries until they are all soaked in the syrup and are thor\u00adoughly warmed.\n\n(You don't want to actually cook the cherries, just let them absorb the syrup.) Return the liquid and cherries to a simmer and pour in the brandy, rum, and bourbon, stirring to mix.\n\nWhen the liquid is warmed through, remove the pot from the heat.\n\n(Be sure not to boil the liquid because you don't want to cook off too much alcohol.) Using a wide-mouth funnel or jar filler and a slotted spoon, pack each canning jar with cherries, filling it to the top.\n\nGive the jar a good tap on the counter to settle the fruit so there are minimal air gaps.\n\nLadle the hot syrup into the jars up to about half an inch from the rim.\n\nPlace the flat part of the lid on the jar, and screw the band on lightly.\n\nAllow them to cool and let the seals form properly.\n\nYou'll hear a nice pop as the vacuum forms and the lid is sucked down.\n\nTighten the rings of all the jars that have sealed properly.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/h5ePpxhzpSQKODJLVRIJm3TXGTs=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2014__06__Brandied-Cherries-37bfe4f22224414ba2961e6fb9930e65.jpg", "authorName": "Jeffrey Morgenthaler", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
