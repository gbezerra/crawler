Not the case with the Witches\u2019 Brew, a smoky scotch sour doused with fino sherry and beet juice, which bubbles violently when served in a glass pipe with dry ice. But if special effects in your drink give you the heebie-jeebies, skip them. This Halloween cocktail is just as much of a treat without the tricks.\n\nAdd all ingredients except the beet juice into a shaker with ice and shake until chilled.\n\nStrain into a glass pipe or rocks glass over fresh ice.\n\nTop with the beet juice.\n\n*Dry ice: For the full Halloween effect, drop a small cube of dry ice into the glass using tongs or sturdy gloves. Never use bare hands. Wait for the smoking to stop and the ice to completely melt before drinking your cocktail. Never ingest dry ice.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/uytqaGxa1vZBLer4KvfuHcfJuR0=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__10__01120755__Witch-Brew-720x720-recipe-579cfde4b03d454682ea208a141d28f8.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
