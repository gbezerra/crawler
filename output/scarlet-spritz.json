Getting to the end of it, of course. Head bartender Brandon Lockman, the head bartender at Red Star Tavern in Portland, Ore., meets that challenge with this Spritz version filled with fresh, seasonal flavors. He infuses with strawberries and stirs it with ap\u00e9ritif and rhubarb bitters, served in an absinthe-rinsed Nick & Nora glass and topped with sparkling wine. It comes alongside a tiny carafe nestled in ice, to refill your glass as it\u2019s depleted.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c9 Spritzes to Take You Through the End of Summer.\u201d\n\nCoat the inside of a coupe or Nick & Nora glass with absinthe, remove the excess and set aside.\n\nAdd the infused Aperol, Lillet and rhubarb bitters to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into the prepared glass.\n\nTop with sparkling wine.\n\nGarnish with a speared strawberry and lemon twist.\n\nServe the remainder of the drink in a small carafe over ice alongside, if desired.\n\n*Strawberry-infused Aperol: Soak 1/2 pint fresh strawberries in 1 750 mL bottle Aperol for at least 8 hours or overnight, then strain out solids.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/BbtfH0MJeVuy-AV34FDA0JVYte0=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__08__14084904__scarlet-spritz-720x720-recipe-2b7385cb983149a681b81b85cdec7638.jpg", "authorName": "Brandon Lockman", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
