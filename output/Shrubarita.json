Typically some variety of sugar does the heavy lifting, but here maple syrup offers a perfect hit of character and complexity. And although the beets maybe seem like an odd or unnecessary addition, they actually keep the sweetness in check with a welcome earthiness, and the shrub makes a fantastic mixer in this riff on a Margarita.\n\nAdd the mezcal, maple beet shrub, lime juice and ice to a cocktail shaker and shake well.\n\nOn one plate, pour the maple syrup. On another plate, mix the salt and pepper. Dip the rocks glass in the maple syrup and gently shake to remove excess before dipping into the salt and pepper mixture.\n\nStrain the drink into the prepared glass, and garnish with a lime wheel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/UMuFmkYyVroRjYrvBf6ALbVD-vs=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__04__13070944__shrubartita-720x720-recipe-766b570e8e70495195df06e30bbd75a5.jpg", "authorName": "Casey Elsass", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
