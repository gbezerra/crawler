Where it differs markedly is in the inclusion of cr\u00e8me de noyaux, a once popular but relatively forgotten liqueur that is similar to amaretto. The red color of the liqueur usually comes from cochineal, which doesn\u2019t affect the singular herbal-meets-bitter almond flavor.\n\nAdd all of the ingredients into a shaker filled of ice and shake until cold.\n\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass, and garnish with grated nutmeg.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/nyzLUutaJ-PBOOLQoZEHBnXxotA=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__01__05084535__pink-squirrel-720x720-recipe-a7243f56eb2a4b8695ec1f8263bbe337.jpg", "authorName": "Lesley Jacobs Solmonson", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
