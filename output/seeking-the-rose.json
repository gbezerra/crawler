It was inspired by the Denver bartender\u2019s lifelong love of flowers and all the times she\u2019d gone hunting for roses and wildflowers around Colorado.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a Collins glass.\n\nFill glass halfway with pebble ice.\n\nSwizzle with the pebble ice, then top off with more pebble ice.\n\n*Pistachio orgeat: Pulse 2 cups raw, shelled pistachios in a food processor until finely ground. Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 1/4 cups water in a pot over medium heat, and stir until sugar dissolves completely. Boil the syrup for 3 minutes, then add in the ground pistachios. Turn the heat down to low, and simmer for another 3 minutes, then slowly increase the temperature to medium high. Just before it starts to boil, remove it from the heat and cover with a lid. Allow the covered nut mixture to infuse for 3 to 8 hours. Strain it through 2 layers of cheesecloth, discarding the ground hazelnuts for another use. Stir 1/2 tsp orange flower water and 1 oz vodka into the syrup. Use a small funnel to portion the orgeat into bottles or a jar. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/nkQgybZ4O4tcNbLxdNtU1qbtRPc=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__07__27104838__lucybeaugard-11-50d6e2a8a74e417a8afa22afbedf471d.jpg", "authorName": "Cheyenne Haggard", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
