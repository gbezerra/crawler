Was it first dreamed up by a Tijuana bartender in the late-1930s? Or did a Texas socialite invent it 10 years later at her Acapulco villa?\n\nShort answer: It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that someone, somewhere summoned the sacred mixture of tequila, lime, orange liqueur and sugar and gifted it to the world. Our love affair with the Margarita has endured for more than 70 years, even as we\u2019ve often saddled it with our most dubious creative impulses. Chocolate Margarita, anyone?\n\nOver the years, one thing has remained true: The best Margaritas are always the simplest, made with fresh ingredients and quality spirits. That means no premade or presweetened mixes. No one has yet to package one that tastes as good as the juice from a newly squeezed lime. That also means using only 100 percent agave tequila.\n\nOur Margarita recipe starts there, then adds an equal-parts sweetener of orange liqueur and agave syrup. The result is a timeless blend of sweet, sour and earthy flavors. Subtle, elegant, boozy and bold\u2014the perfect cocktail, really. It\u2019s easy to see why someone would want to claim it as their own.\n\nAdd the ingredients to a shaker filled with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass or rocks glass filled with fresh ice.\n\nGarnish with a lime wheel.\n\nFor a slightly sweeter drink, add a dash of agave syrup (one part water, two parts agave nectar) before shaking.\n\n.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/5-DAcHzoY-l9KgaJkkL7cXbKWVk=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__16132003__margarita-rocks-salt-720sq-2339978e7f0e48b1ab688df9cc074c06.jpg", "authorName": "Dale DeGroff", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
