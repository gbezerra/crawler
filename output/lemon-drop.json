Its inventor, Norman Jay Hobday, an out-of-work Vietnam vet turned saloon owner, is also credited with opening the country\u2019s first fern bar, a concept that mixed house plants and Tiffany lamps with throngs of upwardly mobile urbanites.\n\nBoth were an instant hit. And for two-plus decades, the Lemon Drop dominated cocktail menus from North Beach to Bangkok, hooking a generation of bargoers on its boozy-tart-sweet melange of vodka, citrus and sugar. Oprah famously served one to Rachel Ray on her show.\n\nSome mislabel the Lemon Drop a Martini. But the drink\u2019s closest cocktail kin is the Crusta, a New Orleans invention that dates back to the 1850s and, like the Lemon Drop, is distinguished by its sugared rim. It\u2019s tempting, while whipping up a batch of Lemon Drops, to skip this important step. Don\u2019t. That first saccharine brush against the lips before the onrush of orange, lime and booze fill your mouth is the Lemon Drop\u2019s calling card. If you don\u2019t believe us, just ask Oprah.\n\nCoat the rim of a cocktail glass with sugar and set aside (do this a few minutes ahead of time so the sugar can dry and adhere well to the glass).\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into the prepared glass.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/9Lp80q6wVRaH-iVioDMGWhVRpxE=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__07__27061510__lemon-drop-720x720-recipe-6a6889c1253249e1b1ffbd58c42b65b8.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 70, "avgRating": 4.5}
