Four different\u2014and disparate\u2014spirits slugging it out in a single glass, along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat house hazing than one of the world\u2019s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Long Island Iced Tea succeeds where so many of today\u2019s refined cocktails fall short: It\u2019s boozy AF\u2014nearly four ounces of alcohol against less than half that amount in mixers. Unless you\u2019re a sailor on shore leave, that\u2019s a red-flag ratio rife with morning-after consequences. It\u2019s also precisely what a person needs every now and then.\n\nBest then not to intellectualize the Long Island Iced Tea and simply love it for what it is: an easy-gulping, one-and-done stiffy. If you\u2019re looking to tame your tea a bit, pull back the boozy parts from three-quarter ounce to half-ounce, and lean in on the cola. The good people of Long Island won\u2019t be offended.\n\nAdd all ingredients except the cola into a Collins glass with ice.\n\nTop with a splash of the cola and stir briefly.\n\nGarnish with a lemon wedge.\n\nServe with a straw.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/6_4Q6h9G9DGZ-fdcIqK9Igvv9No=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__03__14090749__Long-Island-Iced-Tea-720x720-article-272623f47e80457594178a552f708068.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 109, "avgRating": 4.5}
