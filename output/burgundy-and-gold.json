Diedrich\u2019s drink is a Whiskey Sour variation, bolstered by citrusy kalamansi and balanced with a deep, fruity ruby port float. It\u2019s based on Copper Fox rye whiskey. \u201cIt\u2019s a nod to rye whiskey, which was one of the first spirits to be made in D.C.,\u201d he says. The kalamansi gives the cocktail a great gold color, and the port float adds the burgundy, echoing the team colors. \u201cA gold-rimmed glass is a plus,\u201d he says.\n\nAdd all of the ingredients except for the port to a shaker filled with ice, and shake until frothy and chilled.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass filled with ice, and gently float the ruby port over the back of a barspoon on top of the drink.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/LGUqvM3FTd90rxmAak9W11aLKBo=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__22151432__burgundy-and-gold-720x720-recipe-230cc652ab7544d5a9197ff4089495b0.jpg", "authorName": "Kevin Diedrich", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
