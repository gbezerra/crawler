Once the mixture begins to bubble, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, let cool completely and transfer to a large glass container. (Keeps in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.) Spread the pumpkin butter out on a large pan with a high rim. Pour a 750 mL bottle of bourbon on top, cover and let it infuse for an hour. Place the pan in the freezer to allow the alcohol to separate.
