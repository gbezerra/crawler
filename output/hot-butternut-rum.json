Substituting sugar pumpkin, though, is just a little bit more fun. The twee-looking pumpkin is typically no bigger than eight inches and lends a velvety texture to the cocktail. Plus it\u2019s downright adorable. (Bonus: Pull double duty and roast the seeds.)\n\nBrew the tea and pour it into a mug.\n\nAdd the rum and falernum, stir, then swirl in the butternut squash butter, steaming with a frothing wand if desired.\n\nAdd maple syrup to taste.\n\n*Butternut squash butter: In a small mixing bowl, combine 2.5 oz of squash pur\u00e9e, 2.5 oz of room-temperature unsalted butter, .5 tsp of ground cinnamon, .5 tsp of ground nutmeg, .5 tsp of allspice, a pinch of ground cloves, .75 oz of dark brown sugar, .5 tsp of maple syrup and a pinch of salt; mix until smooth.
