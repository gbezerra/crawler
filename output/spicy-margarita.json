That is to say, it refocuses the classic tequila cocktail without losing what\u2019s essential to its success: that timeless blend of sweet, sour and earthy flavors. The key is to use fresh jalape\u00f1o. Two muddled coins, with seeds removed, yields a conservatively spicy drink. But for a spicier Spicy Margarita, throw in a third coin. It\u2019s the perfect cocktail to fire up your summer.\n\nRub the rim of a rocks glass with a lime wedge, dip in salt to coat and set aside.\n\nAdd the jalape\u00f1o coins into a shaker and gently muddle.\n\nAdd remaining ingredients and ice and shake until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into prepared glass over fresh ice.\n\nGarnish with a jalape\u00f1o coin.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/JSnkt3Sg_C1q43tjS7nguzJDSEE=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__07__22133347__spicy-margarita-720x720-recipe-abae7f54dc374676aa21ca91a61a7c2a.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 16, "avgRating": 4.5}
