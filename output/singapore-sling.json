The original recipe is attributed to Raffles bartender Ngiam Tong Boon and is a variant on the Gin Sling.\n\nOur recipe evokes the classic recipe, which is fruit-forward, herbaceous and strong, though most incarnations of the \u201cclassic\u201d Singapore Sling are based on general notes and nostalgia. Later, more modern incarnations of the drink created an overly sweet drink based more on grenadine than citrus. The earliest published version of the recipe was in the 1930 classic by Harry Craddock, \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book.\u201d David A.

Our recipe below is as true to the classic as we can get, but you should feel free to experiment and come up with your own version.\n\nAdd all the ingredients except the club soda into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a highball glass, and top with the club soda.\n\nGarnish with an orange slice and a cherry.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/i8ReQkg5mH2EAsB1jWhO1kFuy-c=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__11__06162353__singapore-sling-720x720-recipe-7c442ca7c9d645dca3dad0f548f98521.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 13, "avgRating": 4.5}
