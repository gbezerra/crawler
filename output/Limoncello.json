Allow the peels to steep for four weeks somewhere dark, like a closet or cabinet.\nStrain the infused vodka into a large bowl and discard the lemon peels. Add one cup of simple syrup to the vodka and stir. Taste for sweetness, adding more simple syrup as desired. Use a funnel to bottle the limoncello and return to a dark area for two more weeks for the flavor to mellow.
