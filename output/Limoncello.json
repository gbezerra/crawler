It's a staple ap\u00e9ritif after many a dinner in Italy, and most restaurants hawk their own brand. Craving the sweet-tart pucker of this golden liqueur? It's sublimely easy to make at home.\n\nUse a vegetable peeler or zester to remove the peels from all of the lemons, avoiding peeling the bitter white pith. Place the lemon peels in a large jar and cover with alcohol. Allow the peels to steep for four weeks somewhere dark, like a closet or cabinet.\n\nStrain the infused vodka into a large bowl and discard the lemon peels. Add one cup of simple syrup to the vodka and stir. Taste for sweetness, adding more simple syrup as desired. Use a funnel to bottle the limoncello and return to a dark area for two more weeks for the flavor to mellow. Chill thoroughly in the freezer before serving.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/lmALry3O05aoseKTmc_Q-09odB8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2015__04__limoncello-recipe-44f94de1c2754963be1d3186e1198c87.jpg", "authorName": "Amanda Marsteller", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
