For a more assertive cocktail, use a high-proof bourbon like Booker\u2019s or Wild Turkey 101.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake for 30 seconds.\n\nStrain into a chilled rocks glass with one large ice cube.\n\nGarnish with a lemon peel.\n\n*Honey syrup: Add 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup water to a small saucepan over medium heat. (You can experiment and decide how much of a honey flavor you want in your syrup. The more honey you use, the thicker the syrup and stronger in flavor it will be.) Stir until blended. Strain into a jar and seal tightly with a lid. Will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/js0IxtkrCFrjzQQ67b2Rbvd3vI8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__10__12140014__gold-rush-720x720-recipe-1ff0ea88d3ca4b279cb037bfa086bf31.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 22, "avgRating": 5.0}
