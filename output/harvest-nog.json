Two different approaches to preparing acorn squash allow the vegetable to flex its muscles in a couple of different directions. For the vegetable-cocktail skittish, though, never fear: Allspice and clove help the drink to retain a more traditional \u201cnog\u201d flavor profile while adding in a welcome dose of crispness.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a shaker and shake vigorously.\n\nDouble-strain into a double-rocks glass over ice, and garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.\n\n*Green acorn squash cordial: Add 1.5 cups of squash pur\u00e9e, 1 cup granulated sugar and .5 tsp of whole allspice into a saucepan, and bring to a simmer, stirring slowly. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Once cool, strain through fine-mesh cloth into a clean bowl. Stir in 1 cup of vodka in the mixture until combined. Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\n\n**Roasted white acorn squash pur\u00e9e: Quarter and deseed a whole squash, then pierce the squash flesh with 10 to 12 cloves, depending on the size of the squash. Roast at 414\u00b0F in an oven-safe pan until the flesh is tender. Allow to cool and remove the cloves. Place the cooled squash in a blender, and pulse until smooth, streaming in cold water until the desired pur\u00e9e consistency is reached. Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/dOqP2c624Id_mC4PDWZOh6M_97E=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__16074007__harvest-nog-720x720-recipe-2d4ef2c648474f76a7a57526530113e6.jpg", "authorName": "Vance Henderson", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
