She experimented with using a syrup instead of a shrub, but the latter ended up keeping the drink more fresh and tart. White balsamic vinegar, made in Italy from the trebbiano grape, is mixed with white wine vinegar and cooked at a low temperature to retain its clearish color.\n\nRub the lemon wedge on half of the outside of a coupe glass, coat with the basil salt mixture and set aside.\n\nAdd the gin and syrup to a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until chilled.\n\nDouble-strain into the prepared coupe glass.\n\nFloat the chilled prosecco on top.\n\n*Honeydew-basil-white-balsamic shrub: Cut off the rind and remove the seeds from 1 whole honeydew, then cut the melon into chunks. Combine it in the blender with 1 cup fresh basil, and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a saucepan, add 4 cups white sugar and 4 cups cold water, and simmer until the sugar has dissolved, being careful not to overheat. Remove it from the heat and let it cool, then strain through a chinois cloth. Add 1 1\u20442 cups white balsamic vinegar, and keep the shrub in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/rLxwhlqtKHfjBQEW6rDDIfHOD5s=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__05__23085409__land-of-happy-720x720-recipe-cd2657d8a00b4546a5a40771befa04a9.jpg", "authorName": "Jennifer Knott", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
