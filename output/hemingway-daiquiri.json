His request for a Daiquiri made with half the sugar and double the booze created an unbalanced drink: one that bartenders couldn't help but right through the eventual addition of maraschino liqueur and grapefruit juice. To reinstate some of Hemingway's influence, this frozen variation of the standard recipe uses key lime juice and goes for a whir in the blender, as the earliest Daiquiris were served over crushed ice.\n\nAdd all ingredients into a blender with ice and pulse the blender until the drink has a slushy consistency.\n\nPour into glass.\n\nGarnish each with a lime wheel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/54lVA3ZJtQqMXkVOrIfXsWBQuLM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/recipe-hemingway-daiquiri_main_720x720-a170690731524342b8b2f7b61b187422.jpg", "authorName": "Kaitlyn Goalen", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
