Brown sugar lends an earthy sweetness to this drink, whose complexity is in indirect proportion to the effort it takes to whip it up.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c5 Build-in-the-Glass Bourbon Cocktails to Make at Home.\u201d\n\nIn a rocks glass, muddle the bitters, syrup, orange peel and cherry.\n\nAdd the bourbon and 1 large ice cube and stir.\n\nGarnish with an orange peel \u201crose\u201d by rolling 2 swaths of orange peels with a Luxardo maraschino cherry inside.\n\n*Brown-butter-washed bourbon: Slowly brown 1/2 cup unsalted butter in a saucepan until well-toasted with a nutty aroma. Remove it from the heat and allow it to cool. Pour a 750 mL bottle of Benchmark bourbon (or a bourbon of your choice) until a plastic container, and gently stir in the brown butter. Leave the mixture uncovered until it\u2019s completely cool and the butter has become firm and risen to the top of the container. Freeze mixture, skim off solids, then strain through cheesecloth to remove all solids. Cover with lid, label and date. Bourbon will keep for a few weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/KGL313Mi8vhsYxHAs3ueYuBDLow=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__04__23072645__5-build-in-the-glass-bourbon-cocktails-to-make-at-home-720x-720-article-96c96b0b962f4daca915b4540608817c.jpg", "authorName": "Lu Brow", "reviewCount": 9, "avgRating": 4.0}
