The name comes from the cheer \u201cWho dey!\u201d that fans chant at games, a phrase undeniably similar to the Saints\u2019 \u201cWho dat!\u201d and the source of an ongoing chicken-or-egg conversation.\n\nCut 4 long and thin orange peels, and press them firmly onto the inside of a coupe.\n\nAdd the rum, syrup and mint to a mixing glass with ice, and stir until chilled.\n\nStrain into the coupe carefully, trying not to disturb the peels, though some will undoubtedly float in the glass.\n\nGently top with the stout, and yell \u201cWho Dey!\u201d.\n\n*Vanilla simple syrup: Combine 1 cup water, 1 cup sugar and 2 split vanilla beans in a small pot, and stir. Bring to a rolling boil, stirring to prevent scorching. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Strain through a fine sieve and discard the vanilla beans. Will keep in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/oW-UZ6CkNI17hvx8mX86-Ud5SnM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__10__26145146__who-dey-720x720-recipe-63f00d17f24849298433a717bbefd0d0.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
