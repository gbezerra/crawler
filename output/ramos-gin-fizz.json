Combining gin, citrus, egg white and heavy cream, the drink requires vigorous shaking to reach the right texture.\n\nThe story goes that its inventor, Carl Ramos, employed a chain of \u201cshaker men\u201d in his New Orleans bar to meet the constant demand. But don't let that discourage you. Foamy, fresh, floral and delicious, the Ramos Gin Fizz is totally worth rolling up your sleeves for.\n\nAdd all ingredients except the club soda into a shaker and dry-shake vigorously (without ice).\n\nFill with ice and shake again.\n\nStrain into a Collins glass.\n\nPour a little bit of club soda back and forth between the empty halves of the shaker to pick up any residual egg white, then pour into the glass.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/S-4jQhklS-IRL8TRRXFZrCDzmQY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__04__08140002__Ramos-Gin-Fizz-720x720-recipe-8c5c98e081b84cdd8d0a587de32d9573.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 19, "avgRating": 5.0}
