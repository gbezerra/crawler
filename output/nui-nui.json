Fortunately, Beachbum Berry unlocked the recipe behind Don's classic tiki cocktail, the Nui Nui, which brims over with island rum and spices.\n\nAdd all ingredients to a blender.\n\nFlash-blend at high speed for no more than five seconds.\n\nPour into a tall glass and add ice to fill.\n\n*Cinnamon-Infused Sugar Syrup: Crush 3 cinnamon sticks and place in a saucepan with 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Lower heat, cover saucepan and simmer for two minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and, keeping it covered, let sit at least two hours before straining and bottling. It will keep, covered and refrigerated, for about 1 month.\n\n**Vanilla-Infused Sugar Syrup: Flatten two vanilla beans with the flat edge of a knife. Split beans in half lengthwise and scrape out the pulp. Place the split beans and the bean pulp in a saucepan with 1.5 cups sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Lower heat, cover saucepan and simmer for two minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and, keeping it covered, let sit at least two hours before straining and bottling.
