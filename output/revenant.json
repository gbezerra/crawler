He boils Fee Brothers. Aztec chocolate bitters and cardamom bitters, taking advantage of the fact that since they\u2019re both glycerin-based they smoke but don\u2019t burn the way those made from alcohol would. A snifter is filled with smoke and covered with a coaster, and the drink is then poured tableside from a carafe.\n\n\u201cChinato is a great replacement for vermouth and adds an herbal complexity, [while] dry cura\u00e7ao helps to lift it,\u201d says Filkins. \u201cThe smoke adds a wow factor when it goes to the table, and chocolate and cardamom bring aromatic complexity and warm baking spices.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c4 Smart Ways to Smoke Your Bourbon Cocktails.\u201d\n\nHeat an empty Turkish coffeepot. When it begins to steam, add both bitters.\n\nWhen it begins to smoke, fill a chilled snifter with the smoke and cover with a coaster.\n\nAdd remaining ingredients and ice into a mixing glass and stir until well-chilled.\n\nRemove coaster from prepared glass and strain drink into it.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/NL8WtNBaaMh_WxskVpq31zFav70=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__09__27141456__Revenant-720x720-slideshow-2a50655df07c4f9a8728f5b25154a031.jpg", "authorName": "John Filkins Filkins", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
