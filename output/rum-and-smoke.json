But slip it underneath a glass cloche with a flamed rosemary sprig, and you\u2019ve got a cocktail that\u2019s sexy, smoky and cinematic.\n\nIn a mixing glass, add all ingredients with ice and stir until chilled.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.\n\nGarnish with a flamed rosemary sprig.\n\nCover with a glass dome and let sit for 1-2 minutes, or until the cocktail is well smoked, before drinking.\n\n*Smoked-rosemary simple syrup: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 1\u20442 cup sugar, 1\u20442 cup water and zest from 1 orange and stir until just under boil. Remove from heat. With a kitchen torch or lighter, flame one rosemary sprig until it begins to smoke on all sides. Drop smoking sprig into saucepan and let steep, covered, for 20 minutes. Strain out solids and store in refrigerator up to one week.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/MhTyZpZhtptULnN7K8upmhyQr8s=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__10__14082007__rum-and-smoke-720x720-article-1d9b0c62022f4c30ae78dc7eadb17f72.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 6, "avgRating": 5.0}
