This recipe from co-owner and bar manager Beau Williams uses Barbadian rum, which lightens the drink, and apple cider syrup for added sweetness. Bonus: The syrup can be further reduced and drizzled over everything from warm apple pie a la mode and coffee cake to pancakes and waffles.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cSo You Love a Whiskey Old Fashioned. How About the Rise of the Rum Old Fashioned?\u201d\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice, and stir until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into an Old Fashioned glass.\n\nExpress the oil of an orange twist over the drink, then drop the twist into the drink.\n\n*Apple cider syrup: In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup apple cider and 2 cups brown sugar on medium heat, stirring constantly to emulsify the sugar. Once the liquid reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and continue to stir occasionally until the liquid\u2019s consistency coats the back of a spoon. Add 1 pinch salt, stir, remove it from the heat, and allow it to cool. Transfer the syrup to a Mason jar, and store for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/MFn1iysSghAKqEcgRGxBJhNUYG0=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__01__10093933__Autumn-Rum-Old-Fashioned-720x720-recipe-ecc215acf15c4a06bf83ada38ef64d1c.jpg", "authorName": "Beau Williams", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
