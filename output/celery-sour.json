Combine the pineapple with 1 L London dry gin in a vacuum bag and seal. Cook sous vide for 2 hours at 155 degrees Fahrenheit, then ice-bath until cold and fine-strain through a coffee filter.\n\n**Celery syrup: Add 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup water and 2 coarsely chopped celery stalks to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes over medium heat. Let cool, then strain into a sealable jar.
