(You can experiment and decide how much of a honey flavor you want in your syrup. The more honey you use, the thicker the syrup and stronger in flavor it will be.) Stir until blended. Strain into a jar and seal tightly with a lid. Will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/uoKOlIogJQzLHkLgUr_WqmA11Ik=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__01__23141334__tequila-honeybee-720x720-recipe-bf3a3564cd77495882360ebc92194676.jpg", "authorName": "Nick Korbee", "reviewCount": 12, "avgRating": 3.5}
