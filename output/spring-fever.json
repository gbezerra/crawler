Aside from the ros\u00e9, the use of Nikolaihof elderflower syrup is a key ingredient to help give it a romantic tinge\u2014something you can imagine tasting in the garden of a queen. Another suggestion to give the drink a bit of a kick: Add an ounce of cucumber gin like Hendrick\u2019s to help enhance both the booze level and that pretty floral essence.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c4 Ros\u00e9 Cocktails You Absolutely Need This Summer.\u201d\n\nPour the wine into a wine glass with ice.\n\nAdd all the other ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nPour into the wine glass.\n\nGarnish with a lemon wheel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/MOqP0EQ0mCRFcS2wqq0ZlGaEj6k=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__07__13081123__4-Rose-Cocktails-You-Need-This-Summer-spring-fever-720x720-slideshow-f66545ef5dd942a6bb2e972e746e79af.jpg", "authorName": "Jamie Steinberg", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
