It reached its height of popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show \u201cSex and the City\u201d was at its peak. The pink-hued Martini was a favorite of the characters on the show.\n\nAccording to Gary Regan, the original Cosmopolitan was created by South Beach bartender Cheryl Cook. Eager to invent a new cocktail for the Martini glass, Cook riffed on the classic Kamikaze using a newly introduced citrus-flavored vodka plus a splash of cranberry juice.\n\nThere\u2019s some debate about who created the original Cosmopolitan, whether it was Cook, Dale DeGroff (at New York City's Rainbow Room) or Toby Cecchini, who devised a Cosmo in 1988 during his tenure at NYC\u2019s Odeon. However, all agree that Cecchini popularized the vodka-and-cranberry \u2019Tini.\n\nThis recipe appeared as part of \u201cLet's Stop Pretending the Cosmopolitan Is a Terrible Drink. It Isn't.\"\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\n\nGarnish with a lime wheel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/ZdCK8zIDfRT30l11xSlXh-2EEJ4=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__11__06100445__cosmopolitan-720x720-recipe-5e1384bd37044ec3ad4034cd811b78f3.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 66, "avgRating": 4.5}
