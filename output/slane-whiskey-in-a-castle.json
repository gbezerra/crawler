But he\u2019s a winner of the Slane Cocktail Series because it tastes as good as it looks.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until chilled.\n\nStrain into a chilled rocks glass over ice.\n\nGarnish with a flaming potato skin ontop of a dehydrated lime slice.\n\n*Plum-vanilla syrup: In an empty saucepan, add 4 diced plums, 1 qt. granulated cane sugar, 1 qt. water and 2 Madagascar vanilla beans. Simmer on low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and refrigerate for one week before straining into a sealed container.\n\n**If feeling really inspired, try crafting a 3-1/2-foot-tall multichamber ice castle by fusing together 2\u201d x 2\u201d cubes. The entire process takes about 2 weeks, but your cocktail will never be colder.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/Eojp7JNL-haDeHsKGrrwZ7Ynh_k=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__07__11102505__slane-winner-2018-eli-shapiro_720x720-381064bc58aa4dc6ba391fd7c2767766.jpg", "authorName": "Eli Shapiro", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
