Equally at home in a snowbound mountain cabin as it is on an acclaimed cocktail menu, the Hot Toddy has one job that it takes quite seriously: warming you up.\n\nThe Hot Toddy has been linked to warming up winter nights next to a fireplace, as well as warding off colds. You can use any kind of whiskey you like in this hot and comforting classic, and the end result will be equally delicious. Grab your favorite mug, and get ready for a warm whiskey embrace.\n\nFill a mug with boiling water and let stand for a minute or two to warm.\n\nMeanwhile, stick the cloves into the lemon peel or wheel and set aside.\n\nEmpty the mug and fill about halfway with fresh boiling water.\n\nAdd the sugar and stir to dissolve.\n\nAdd the prepared lemon peel or wheel and stir.\n\nAdd the lemon juice and whiskey, and stir again.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/CEZfDh9Sf8RjquEdNe7YeTjIBoM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__11__14112604__hot-toddy-720x720-recipe-3c3c20f0eb044e329392fe9447016867.jpg", "authorName": "Jacques Bezuidenhout", "reviewCount": 27, "avgRating": 4.5}
