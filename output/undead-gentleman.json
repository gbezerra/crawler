Add 3 halved 6-inch pieces of cinnamon stick to the water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add 4 cups of granulated sugar and stir with a whisk (or an immersion blender) until dissolved for about 1 minute. The liquid should become clear such that you can see the bottom of the pot. Immediately remove from the heat. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 12 hours. Strain through cheesecloth into a bowl, and then use a funnel to pour into a lidded bottle or other sealable container. The syrup will keep, refrigerated, for several weeks. Makes 4 cups (32 oz).", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/1WLmE00ds9pyVffK6TOKEs4kplI=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__06__15161908__undead-gentleman-720x720-recipe-7e5d9194eaff44b58fe3dcf764105430.jpg", "authorName": "Martin Cate", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
