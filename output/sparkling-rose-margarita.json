Two warm-weather booze titans come together in this fun, fizzy punch of sparkling ros\u00e9 and strawberry- and basil-infused tequila. Pro tip: Opt for a bubbly on the drier side to keep the flavors from leaning too sweet.\n\nIn a punch bowl, combine the tequila, lime juice and agave syrup.\n\nAdd cubed ice, and stir with a ladle to mix.\n\nTop with the sparkling ros\u00e9.\n\nGarnish with 1 cup sliced strawberries and lime wheels from 2 limes.\n\nRim punch glasses with rose salt before serving (optional).\n\n*Strawberry-basil-infused blanco tequila: In a glass jar, combine 1/2 cup sliced strawberries and 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves with 1 750 mL bottle blanco tequila. Seal jar tightly and let sit, unrefrigerated, for 3-5 days. Shake daily. Strain out solids, and rebottle the infused tequila.\n\n** Rose salt: Add 4 tbsp sea salt and 1 tbsp dried rose buds to a mortar and pestle, and gently grind.
