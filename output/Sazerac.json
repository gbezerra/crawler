In 2008, it was crowned the official cocktail of New Orleans, a designation more suited to marketers than drink mixers. The truth is the Sazerac has always belonged to the Crescent City.\n\nUp until the late 1800s, it was made with French brandy as a base\u2014Sazerac de Forge et Fils, to be exact\u2014before bartenders switched to rye, the spirit newly arriving by the barge-load down the Mississippi. A well-made Rye Sazerac is indeed a tasty thing, full of spice and depth, though perhaps, we think, a hair too much muscle.\n\nWhich is why Liquor.com\u2019s house recipe combines equal parts cognac and rye, not as a gestural homage to a lost classic but because the two work together so perfectly. The coupling is a boozy yin-yang that when accented by the licorice flavors of absinthe produces a cocktail that\u2019s simultaneously soft and bold, smooth and brash, and so unmistakably New Orleans.\n\nRinse a chilled rocks glass with absinthe, discarding any excess, and set aside.\n\nIn a mixing glass, muddle the sugar cube, water and both bitters.\n\nAdd the rye and cognac fill with ice, and stir until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into the prepared glass.\n\nTwist a slice of lemon peel over the surface to extract the oils and then discard.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/oRk-QXORrzqfcwbwR_yP2GkBAMU=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__05__10145323__sazerac-720x720-recipe-2c78066a77ab453481aceb83c219d78f.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 31, "avgRating": 4.5}
