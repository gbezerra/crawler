Joseph Ehrmann\u2019s take on Eggnog blends a\u00f1ejo tequila with amontillado sherry and lets the mixture age in-house for three months before using it in his A\u00f1ogo. \"You'll usually get nice citrus notes, which are highlighted by the toasted orange oils sprayed on the surface,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the sherry notes add a buttery and nutty quality.\u201d The recipe calls for 1 1/2 ounces of tequila, but Ehrmann recommends punching that up to increase the baked agave flavors, not to mention the booziness, of the drink.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cNot All Eggnogs Are Created Equal: 3 Recipes to Keep Close This Holiday Season.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a rocks glass over ice and stir well.\n\nGarnish with a flamed orange peel.\n\n*Eggnog: In a stand mixer bowl, beat 4 egg yolks until light in color. Slowly add 1/3 cup organic sugar and beat until completely dissolved. Add 16 oz whole milk, 1 cup heavy cream and 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg, then stir to combine. Set aside in refrigerator and store until service. When serving, place 4 egg whites in stand mixer bowl (or in chilled metal mixing bowl) and beat to soft peaks. With mixer still running, slowly add 1 tbsp refined sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Gently fold egg white mixture into main mixture. (For a lighter version, use half-and-half instead of heavy cream. For a nondairy version, whisk 1/4 cup almond butter into 24 oz unsweetened almond milk, instead of milk and heavy cream; or use 1 pt almond milk and 1 cup cooked oatmeal, then blend entire batch until smooth.).", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/KGovFHqe5eDTLk9_c8EyLQ-8Leg=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__12__17140449__Anogo-2-Jonathan-Fong_article_720x720-2fae29aaab7f40008ca21f6675254d11.jpg", "authorName": "H.
