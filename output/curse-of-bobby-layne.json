The idea is to have the vinegar create a really pungent garnish, kind of like a pickled onion on a Martini. Fresh berries will lack that zing, so I\u2019d definitely suggest pickling them or even just soaking them overnight in Champagne vinegar to at least get some of that flavor.\u201d\n\n(As for the name, in 1958, the Lions traded quarterback Bobby Layne to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Layne, in response, supposedly said the Lions would not win for 50 years\u2014though this statement has been disputed as a hoax and was never published at the time. But for the next 50 years, the Lions had the worst winning percentage of any NFL team.)\n\nAdd all of the ingredients to a mixing glass with ice and stir until chilled.\n\nStrain into a cocktail glass or coupe, and garnish with 3 pickled blueberries on a toothpick.\n\n*Pickled blueberries: Gently warm blueberries in a small pot with a little Champagne vinegar, salt and sugar, and let cool overnight.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/VrRORTUhptW-Z0FHf3edsifH8aw=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__01084036__curse-of-bobby-layne-720x720-recipe-c3f0d67d7b844f66be7b9df1e1f9b2ab.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
