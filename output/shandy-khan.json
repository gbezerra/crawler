It's bright and refreshing without being so boozy that you\u2019re in trouble before the fourth quarter starts,\u201d says Strickland. \"If you are a savvy tailgater, you will cook up a batch beforehand and simply top them off with beer and \u2018blue stuff\u2019 as you go.\u201d\n\nAdd the rum, lemon juice, syrup and bitters to a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a Collins glass (or red Solo cup) over ice, and top with the beer.\n\nFloat a pour of the blue cura\u00e7ao on top, and garnish with half an orange wheel.\n\n*Honey syrup: Add .25 cup water and .5 cup honey to a small saucepan over medium heat, and stir until the honey completely melts. Strain into a jar and seal with a lid.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/WFk_fX7CLnQjJ-u1HbwA9Juxtuw=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__01090100__shandy-khan-720x720-recipe-e70775d9810b42d78a108a8c65df92c2.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
