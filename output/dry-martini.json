Was it a California prospector during the 1849 Gold Rush or the barman at a flossy New York City hotel 50 years later? Both stories hold water. Neither will leave you feeling as blissful and content as a well-made Dry Martini.\n\nStart with a good London-style gin. From there, add a little (not too much!) dry vermouth and dash of orange bitters. And despite the prissy demands of a certain fictional British spy, stir (don\u2019t shake!) the hell out of it with ice and strain it into a glass named after the cocktail itself. Twist a lemon peel, and there you have it, a Dry Martini. It\u2019s a drink worth getting to the bottom of.\n\nAdd all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until very cold.\n\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\n\nGarnish with a lemon twist.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/UZk0fxQYotu2meVvJ0gB3kWXM9k=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__09__05093330__dry-martini-720x720-recipe-8a80821c4ca944849690af8cda90cc03.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 36, "avgRating": 4.5}
