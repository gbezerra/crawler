Featuring traditional Mexican flavorings such as fresh sugar cane, guavas and tejocotes (a crabapple-type fruit), the punch is spiked with a healthy dose of rum and served piping hot to ward off any winter chills. Here in the U.S., it can be hard to find these items fresh. So this recipe relies on easy-to-find ingredients that lend their Mexican flair to an irresistible rum punch.\n\nIn a large stockpot, add the water, piloncillo, cinnamon sticks, cloves and tamarind paste, and bring to a boil. Drop to a simmer, and stir to completely dissolve the tamarind paste. Simmer for 15 minutes.\n\nAdd the apples, pear, raisins and hibiscus flowers, and simmer for 15 minutes, until the fruit is soft and raisins are rehydrated.\n\nSqueeze the remaining liquid out of the cheesecloth packet and discard. Remove the cinnamon sticks and cloves and discard. Stir in the lemon juice and rum.\n\nLadle the punch between 12 punch glasses, thinly slice 2 lemons, and garnish each glass with a slice.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/e67z56sd5ftqXqQVsLn7Rz7lZIU=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__21072232__Mexican-Ponche-Navideno-720x720-recipe-60fa6516336848248cb7b847884f02fc.jpg", "authorName": "Lauren Rothman", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
