And its citrus stock recipe, which was conceptualized by co-founder Kelsey Ramage and partner Iain Griffiths alongside Ryan Chetiyawardana in London bar Dandelyan\u2019s juicing room, is a simple yet effective 30-minute process of pressure-cooking spent citrus husks (pulp and all) in water, then straining and adjusting with acid and sugar to produce a liquid that essentially acts as a juice substitute or volume enhancer. It\u2019s a waste-reduction and resource-doubling technique that offers something the usual suspects (oleo saccharum, cordials, preserves, dehydrating for garnishes, and the like) do not.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cRepurpose Your Citrus with This Waste-Reducing Hack.\u201d\n\nAdd the water and husks to a large pot and let boil for 5 minutes.\n\nRemove the husks (your stock will go bitter if you leave any longer), giving a quick squeeze back into the mixture as you pull them out. Remove the liquid from heat quickly and measure. (Accounting for some loss in heat evaporation and absorption from the husks, it should be 44 fluid oz, give or take).\n\nPlace back on high heat until liquid is reduced by 50 percent, then add the sugar.\n\nAdd the citric and malic acid according to ratio based on citrus type.*.\n\nRemove from heat, filter, bottle and refrigerate.\n\n*Acid ratios by based on citrus varieties:Lemon and lime: 3% citric, 2% malicOrange and grapefruit: 2% citric, 1% malicMandarin, etc.: 1% citric, 2% malic.\n\nNote: This recipe can easily be scaled up or down based on how much supply you\u2019re working with or the volume you\u2019re aiming to produce. Citrus stock can be kept fresh for three days or frozen for one month.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/9gMAOIedh71Nu0Y03r2D2hXoyx0=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__03__28201910__citrus-stock-720-720-recipe-4221f5d098c0438a879d5852a99744a4.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
