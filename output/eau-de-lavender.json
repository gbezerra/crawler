It's spring in a cup, but since the floral flavors come from bitters, you can sip it all year round.\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker and dry-shake (without ice).\n\nAdd ice and shake again to emulsify thoroughly.\n\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass.\n\nGarnish with a lavender sprig.\n\n*Honey syrup: Add 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup water to a small saucepan over medium heat. (You can experiment and decide how much of a honey flavor you want in your syrup. The more honey you use, the thicker the syrup and stronger in flavor it will be.) Stir until blended. Strain into a jar and seal tightly with a lid. Will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/YzRmjMHstpQOtSQCAeRKkOaeEoQ=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__01__30135947__Eau-de-Lavender-720x720-recipe-56b01f9ec62f454bb8f67defeeef79e9.jpg", "authorName": "Linnea Covington", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
