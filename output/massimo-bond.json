Shake mixture, then leave at room temperature for 7-9 hours to allow flavors to infuse. Place jar in the freezer overnight to solidify fats. The next day, use a knife to break up coagulated fat at top of jar and strain spirit through a coffee filter or a cheese cloth. Strain again as desired to remove any leftover fat. Reserve in bottle until ready to use.\n\n**Pink Himalayan salt solution: Add 1/2 cup pink Himalayan salt and 1/2 cup water into a small bowl. Stir until salt dissolves and reserve.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/70zUdC-CzpdNDSUcPUK9LnLzWCY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__07__22142929__The-Best-Dirty-Martini-Youre-Never-Going-to-Actually-Be-Able-to-Drink-720x720-article-b797243470c646b1881586655be12da2.jpg", "authorName": "Manuel Mora", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
