It\u2019s light in body but full of flavor.\u201d\n\nAdd all the ingredients to shaker and dry-shake (without ice) for 10 seconds.\n\nAdd 3 or 4 ice cubes and shake very well.\n\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass.\n\nGarnish with cinnamon and alderwood-smoked sea salt.\n\n*Spiced date syrup: Add 1 cup water and 1 cup turbinado sugar to a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add 1 cup date molasses and stir until combined. Add 5 crushed cinnamon sticks and 5 crushed black cardamom pods, and simmer for five minutes. Strain into a jar and seal tightly with a lid. Keeps refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/uv-DZb8niWP-Yv5mW4DxcC7uxKw=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__03__17120129__the-shannon-720-720-article-281da9297a474dcf923106ebfa6757e6.jpg", "authorName": "Mike Di Tota", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
