This one by bartender Carmen Polcyn at the now-closed Bar Toma in Chicago also utilizes cranberries and lemon, making it even more festive. Sip the nonalcoholic version all day, or make the cocktail at night for a cool, yet warming, seasonal tipple.\n\nAdd the bitters, lemon juice, pine syrup and cranberries to a shaker, and muddle the cranberries.\n\nAdd the gin or vodka (optional) and ice, and shake until chilled.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass over ice, and top with the lemon-lime soda.\n\nGarnish with 3 cranberries and a sprig of pine.\n\n*Pine syrup: Bring 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar to a boil until dissolved. Reduce heat to low, and add a handful of chopped pine needles. Stir and remove from heat, and let sit for 2 hours. Strain and refrigerate. Keeps up to 3 weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/X4VuzZzM_oYRSKJo0F8JJJ-dp-k=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__18081623__muddled-pine-720x720-recipe-f9200fd189ac40f69879c5c357094002.jpg", "authorName": "Carmen Polcyn", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
