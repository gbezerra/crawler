Typically some variety of sugar does the heavy lifting, but here maple syrup offers a perfect hit of character and complexity. And although the beets maybe seem like an odd or unnecessary addition, they actually keep the sweetness in check with a welcome earthiness, and the shrub makes a fantastic mixer in this gin and Campari cocktail.\n\nAdd the gin, Campari, maple beet shrub and ice to a cocktail shaker and shake well.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass, or coup\u00e9 if you're feeling fancy.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/qLETQER1dYK51orj46p1wvHawVI=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__04__13072747__gcs-720x720-recipe-da33a6c6ee2a45c49618f9b9b79408ac.jpg", "authorName": "Casey Elsass", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
