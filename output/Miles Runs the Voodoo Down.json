Sprinkle sugar in the raw on top of them, and with a culinary torch, br\u00fbl\u00e9e them. Combine the prepared bananas, 1 cinnamon stick and 1 L bourbon in a large jar. Keep it in a cool dark space, and allow to infuse for at least 1 week. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, then again through double-layered cheesecloth. Allow it to rest overnight, and strain again through cheesecloth if necessary.", "imageURL": "//cdn.liquor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/30090735/miles-runs-the-voodoo-down-720x720-recipe.jpg"}
