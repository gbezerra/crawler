In addition, many brands can be \u201cinsipid,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile Pegu Club makes ginger beer by the gallon, here\u2019s a smaller-scale version to try at home. It takes a little time\u2014note the one-hour wait for the ingredients to fully integrate\u2014but yields enough for several cocktails, since only an ounce of this intensely gingery elixir is all that\u2019s needed for maximum piquancy. The recipe does not call for carbonation, however. To make it bubbly, add sparkling water, seltzer or club soda to taste. (Note: Some variations on this recipe call for two ounces of ginger beer when canned versions are used.)\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cThe Secret Weapon That Is Homemade Ginger Beer.\u201d\n\nMakes 1 cup.\n\nAdd water to a pot, and bring to a boil.\n\nStir in the grated ginger. Remove from heat and cover pot. Allow to sit for 1 hour.\n\nStrain through a fine chinois (metal strainer) or cheesecloth. (While straining the ginger, use a spoon or ladle to firmly press down on the ginger to extract more flavor.) The appearance will be cloudy-don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s natural.\n\nAdd lime juice and brown sugar, and let cool.\n\nFunnel into a glass bottle. Cap tightly and store in the refrigerator. Keeps for 2 weeks.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/vso1Qe8IyDsVtc18hlykgg21Z1Q=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__04__23100544__ginger-beer-720x720-recipe-02b32c3fe1b842f6a2b2c2ad9d5b0446.jpg", "authorName": "Audrey Saunders", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
