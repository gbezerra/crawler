The cubes are stirred with the other ingredients to chill and dilute the drink, and the concoction is also served over a smoky cube.\n\n\u201cAs the smoke flavor from the aromatic infusion dissipates, the cocktail slowly infuses with the water from the smoked ice and maintains the prominence of smoke throughout the entirety of the cocktail experience,\u201d says owner Logan Thies. The orange flavor comes from Aperol, which replaces the orange rind in the original. \u201cThe brightening that the citrus oil introduces is beautiful, but I wanted to make the drink more defined and complex while staying true to its nature,\u201d he says.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c4 Smart Ways to Smoke Your Bourbon Cocktails.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into an Old Fashioned glass over the smoked ice cubes.\n\nGarnish with a dehydrated rosemary sprig and dehydrated orange wheel.\n\n*Smoked ice cubes: Fill a smoker with cherrywood chips (or add a smoker box filled with cherrywood chips to a grill). Fill metal containers with water, set inside the smoker or grill, and close the lid. Smoke for 30 minutes or until desired flavor is achieved. Freeze the smoked water in ice cube trays.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/swqZjrCwCaItHe8E16O2NV5BY-A=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__09__27145534__Bourbon-Toscamo-720x720-recipe-c4b01a9bbceb4536aad63576ef2cccb6.jpg", "authorName": "Logan Thies", "reviewCount": 5, "avgRating": 5.0}
