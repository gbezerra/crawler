Erick Castro\u2019s punch checks all the boxes. The co-founder of San Diego's Polite Provisions and Raised by Wolves describes it as \u201ca blend of holiday flavors in a convivial and bubbly format.\u201d It\u2019s a great drink to take your holiday toast up a notch with.\n\nGenever is known for its nutty and earthy flavor, as well as its full-bodied and malty quality. If you like scotch or mezcal, then you\u2019ll most likely enjoy genever, but Castro says that\u2019s not the only appeal of this festive holiday punch. \u201cWhile the recipe calls for genever, which results in a malt-accented beverage rich with baking spice, the beauty of the drink is that it works with virtually any spirit imaginable, he says. \u201cThis comes in handy around the holidays, because after you make two or three of these with the family, the recipe still works even once you run out of genever.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cGive Your Punch Bowl a Purpose with These 3 Holiday Recipes.\u201d\n\nAdd a large block of ice into a punch bowl, or 2 cups of ice cubes.\n\nPour all ingredients into the bowl and give a quick stir.\n\nGarnish with whole star anise, pineapple slices and grated nutmeg.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/CPN77Mrhix_UaxKsOcOAquO5-SM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__12__22201125__Champagne-Punch-credit-Arlene-Ibarra_article_720x720-858843d734d24d43b63dbd7320f8cfd6.jpg", "authorName": "Erick Castro", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
