Add 1 cup white sugar, toss to coat in a glass bowl and store, covered, in the refrigerator overnight. Combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water in a saucepan, simmer until the sugar is dissolved, and remove from the heat. Blend the macerated pineapple in a blender, add the simple syrup, and stir to combine. Strain out solids using a cheesecloth, and store the syrup in the refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/5-_jDhiZIz_ztWvEfQeFQwhMPSU=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__05__23084543__mrs-robinson-720x720-recipe-5d4d4d64af5a4a8b8386dded74d9dc02.jpg", "authorName": "Andrew Call", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
