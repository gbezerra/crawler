Audrey Saunders, the owner of New York City\u2019s iconic Pegu Club, where the Tom & Jerry has been made every year since the bar opened in 2005, says, \u201cEveryone is so worried about maintaining the loft of the batter, but here\u2019s a little secret: The batter doesn't need to be stable at all. It turns out it\u2019s easier to work with once it collapses.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cGive Eggnog the Year Off. The Tom & Jerry Is the Holiday Cocktail of Your Dreams.\u201d\n\nPlace the batter in a preheated 10 oz Irish Coffee mug.\n\nAdd the rum and cognac.\n\nHeat the milk with a hot pot (or in a saucepan).\n\nBriskly stir the batter with a short whisk or spoon while adding the heated milk so that the ingredients are beaten together.\n\nTop with freshly grated nutmeg.\n\n*Tom & Jerry batter: Separate yolks and whites of 12 eggs. Run egg whites through a food processor until stiff. Transfer to a bowl. Run egg yolks until through a food processor until they are thin as water. While the food processor is running, add 2 lbs white sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground allspice, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 2 oz a\u00f1ejo rum (like Plantation Barbados), 6 tbsp fine Madagascar vanilla extract and 4 dashes Angostura bitters to egg yolks. Add egg whites back into egg yolk mixture and whisk together. Store inside a sterilized container in refrigerator.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/NqM7oS2ByGQ4yoLoAPFTtOovlmw=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__12__10122259__tom-and-jerry-720x720-recipe-09c97b305c6c4a0fb820f1ce734a214a.jpg", "authorName": "Audrey Saunders", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
