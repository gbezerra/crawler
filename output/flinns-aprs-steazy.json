He says that high-speed lifts and other technologies have shortened the ski day, causing skiers to wrap up on the mountain earlier. Yeager\u2019s favorite apr\u00e8s cocktail is the Flinn\u2019s Apr\u00e8s Steazy (created by Flinn Pomeroy). \u201cI chose it because it\u2019s delicious and balanced. The amaro is fortified by the rye whiskey and balanced by the bitter and sweet of the Campari and St-Germain.\u201d The drink evokes the surrounding area perfectly. \u201cLike Aspen, this cocktail is highly cultured and at the same time very approachable.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cBartenders Recommend the Best Apr\u00e8s-Ski Drinks in the World.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake vigorously.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.\n\nExpress the oil from a lemon peel and drop in to garnish.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/uPU8pDBoxpCUSjhAVFep3MwMY-4=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__02__20121916__flinns-apres-steazy-720x720-recipe-297711b178cf4d5784c0ebdfbe9476e5.jpg", "authorName": "Flinn Pomeroy", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
