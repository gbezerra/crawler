Using a rich simple syrup made of demerara sugar gives the drink necessary sweetness and balance without turning the drink into the sugary mess that many associate with the Daiquiri.\n\nThe original Daiquiri was invented in the early 1900s but didn\u2019t become popular until the 1940s. World War II rationing made whiskey and vodka hard to come by, but President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy made relations with Latin America better and thus rum easily accessible. It was one of six classic cocktails that was later featured in David A. Embury\u2019s 1948 seminal book on cocktails, \u201cThe Fine Art of Mixing Drinks.\u201d\n\nIn a cocktail shaker, combine all ingredients with large ice cubes. Shake vigorously and strain into a coupe glass.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/G9OKPf753L2Qq1SVBucngh8sanY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__09__01105724__ultimate-daiquiri-720x720-recipe-e56534ef99d549acaec38a7d29f148d3.jpg", "authorName": "Jason Kosmas", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
