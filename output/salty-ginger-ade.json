In India, jaljeera has a similar makeup, but with the specific addition of cumin (jeera translates to cumin in Hindi). The base of the drink is usually a spice mix (cumin, black salt, ginger, mint and fruit powder such as amchoor), sometimes with the addition of muddled dates or tamarind.\n\nWe took our cues from the latter, creating an inspired mocktail with what we had on hand in our pantry. The date gives the drink rich sweetness, while the salt and cumin commingle to create a distinct, almost shrublike effect.\n\nAdd the date, salt, cumin and lime juice to a shaker. Let sit for 5 minutes, then muddle well so the date is pulverized.\n\nAdd ice and shake until chilled, then pour the contents of the shaker into a tall glass.\n\nFill to the rim with ginger beer and stir well to combine. Garnish with a mint sprig.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/vtMHHno2mgaedEmpcJs3_PPzJYE=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__01__06082019__Drink-to-Your-Health-1-Vietnamese-tonic-720x720-recipe-b77745cf5d564979af50ed9b41557af6.jpg", "authorName": "Kaitlyn Goalen", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
