Jon Feuersanger, the beverage director of beast + bottle and Coperta in Denver, created this hot tipple that works with or without booze, and it's perfect for drinking as the snow falls during your next civilized holiday get-together.\n\nAdd the scotch (optional), lemon juice, smoked honey and hot water to a tea cup, and stir.\n\nGarnish with a rosemary sprig, lemon wheel and grated nutmeg.\n\n*Smoked honey: Heat 1 cup of water to a boil, and slowly stir in 2 cups of honey. Heat 1 hardwood charcoal briquette to white-hot temperature over a flame, and submerge it into the honey water. Allow to cool. Remove the briquette, and run the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. Makes 4-6 servings.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/eRbGkFPS2AIl65hDhmaeIj4EMYQ=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__18081834__smoked-toddy-720x720-recipe-32b1eb216d384836a14fa85eada67e41.jpg", "authorName": "Jon Feuersanger", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
