The main ingredient, a bitter French digestif called Amer Picon, is no longer commercially available in the U.S. But that didn\u2019t stop the bar team at San Francisco\u2019s 15 Romolo, whose recipe substitutes a trio of Italian amari to fill in the drink\u2019s intense herbal character.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cPicon Punch Is the Winter Drink You Never Knew You Needed.\u201d\n\nPour the Amer Picon and grenadine into a Georgian Irish Coffee glass over ice and stir briefly.\n\nFill almost to top with the soda water.\n\nFloat the brandy on top.\n\nGarnish with a lemon peel.\n\n*Amer Picon: Because it\u2019s not available in the U.S., as a substitute, combine 2 parts Ramazzotti amaro, 2 parts dry cura\u00e7ao and 1 part gentian liqueur in an airtight bottle and shake. Refrigerate until ready to use.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/yCbjjxqdE8OU_-b6viUBpeU6Xlc=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__01__29093435__picon-punch-720x720-recipe-5676768f97a54ac29086a0ff5ad045b7.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 11, "avgRating": 2.5}
