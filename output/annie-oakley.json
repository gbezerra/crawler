But in liqueur form, it shows delicate and round flavors of melon, cucumber and citrus. \u201cWhile we went for the full herbal, floral explosion with this cocktail, this liqueur shows really beautifully with simple and subtle combinations like a touch of gin or vodka and a dash of interesting bitters, like orange or grapefruit,\u201d says Lovell.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cAloe Water Is the New Coconut Water. Use It in These Soothing Drinks.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.\n\nGarnish with a thyme sprig.\n\n*Hibiscus-thyme shrub: Combine 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup white wine vinegar in a saucepan, and stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Add 1/2 cup dried hibiscus flowers, mix well, and add 24 thyme sprigs. Remove from the heat and let cool, then chill overnight.
