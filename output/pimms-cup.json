The slow-sipping summer cocktail is the preferred vehicle for its eponymous liqueur, a gin-based digestif that spread across the globe and found a loyal fan base in New Orleans. Combined with Sprite/7Up (or ginger ale), cucumber and a medley of fruit garnishes, the drink proved to be a welcome relief from the Southern heat. The Pimm\u2019s Cup is also the favorite cooler at Wimbledon, where it\u2019s still enjoyed by the pitcher.\n\nAdd all ingredients into a highball glass over ice and stir to combine.\n\nGarnish with a mint sprig, skewered strawberry and optional lemon and orange wheels.\n\nTo mix things up a bit, you can replace the Sprite, 7Up or ginger ale with Champagne.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/ZgFXM1WUGOB_ZAxg4YpYE8H4W2E=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__10__29142721__pimms-cup-720x720-recipe-e0c8e82adb6249a898be85f4136f3643.jpg", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": 10, "avgRating": 4.5}
