This involves heating the spirits by pouring very warm water into one mixing tin, then adding the base spirit (in his case, bourbon), allspice dram, lemon juice and house-made ginger syrup in the other and then nestling it in the first. It\u2019s a sort of double-boiler concept to get the spirits warm and release their aromatics. Then add a little hot water, stir and serve.\n\n\u201cI had been served so many warm or lukewarm Toddies that I was looking for a way to drink the whole drink hot,\u201d says Morgenthaler. \u201cA splash of hot water alone doesn\u2019t result in a hot drink. The bain-marie is our way of getting those ingredients up to temperature. That\u2019s the secret to our Hot Toddy\u2014it\u2019s actually hot.\u201d\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cThe Hot Toddy: Everything You Need to Know to Make a Great One.\u201d\n\nStir all the ingredients in a bain-marie until warmed through. (If no bain-marie or double-boiler is available, pour very warm water into a mixing tin, then in a smaller mixing tin, add all the ingredients and nestle the smaller tin inside the larger tin until ingredients are warm.).\n\nPour into a preheated mug and top with 3 oz boiling water.\n\nGarnish with an orange peel.\n\n*Ginger syrup: Roughly chop 8 oz washed, unpeeled ginger (each piece about the size of your pinkie-tip). Put in a blender and combine with equal parts sugar and boiling water. Blend on high until mixture is smooth, then fine-strain through a sieve.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/eWBJyAu1jLxM_ZFeVF-ZPaZYgtM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__11__01145317__Jeffrey-Morgenthalers-Hot-Toddy-720x720-recipe-8f3e55fc4ec2422580cca4c6c8eaca0c.jpg", "authorName": "Jeffrey Morgenthaler", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
