But in the Comrade, the woodsy depth of spaghetti squash and innate vegetative notes of tequila sally forth in entirely novel ways, shining a light on their versatility.\n\nCombine all of the ingredients into a mixing glass and stir until the glass begins to cloud.\n\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass, and garnish with a cinnamon stick.\n\n*Spaghetti squash cordial: Add 1.5 cups of squash pur\u00e9e, 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 sprig of rosemary to a heavy-bottom saucepan, and bring to a rolling simmer over medium heat, stirring slowly. Remove from the heat and let cool. Strain through fine-mesh cloth into a clean bowl, and stir in 1 cup of vodka to the mixture until combined. Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/M2tGt1-YVHo0O82lU4SzbpGCUy8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__11__16081301__comrade-720x720-recipe-eb5fa5b1be98492aa24b4df2a0258210.jpg", "authorName": "Vance Henderson", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
