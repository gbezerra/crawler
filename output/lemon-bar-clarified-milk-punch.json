Muddle the peels, then let the mixture set for a day. In a separate nonreactive container, add the whole milk and crushed graham crackers, steep in the refrigerator for 1 day, and strain out the solids.\n\nJuice the Meyer and regular lemons, and add them to the oleo saccharum along with the first four ingredients, and stir to combine.\n\nTo clarify the punch, slowly pour the lemon-liquor mixture into the strained whole milk.\n\nOnce it has started to curdle, place it in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days, then strain it through a cheesecloth-lined chinois and then a coffee filter if necessary. Keep the punch chilled.\n\nTo serve, pour 3 oz in a mug over ice.\n\nGarnish with ground nutmeg.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/LjHGqzysMrv23gsMMuOhac2AiNY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__12__19124505__lemon-bar-clarified-milk-punch-720x720-recipe-2634eef65b9741ce933881089b24c2ff.jpg", "authorName": "Joel Schmeck", "reviewCount": 5, "avgRating": 2.5}
