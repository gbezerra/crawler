Coder mingles all of them in this decadent summer sipper that thankfully can be more frequent an indulgence than Halley\u2019s Comet, its similarly named astronomical occurrence. \u201cPeaches are in season toward the end of summer and partner perfectly with bourbon,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can imagine peaches, blackberries, almond and cream combining to make a perfect dessert, so why not a cocktail?\u201d It\u2019s easily scalable and batchable for backyard barbecues or summer soirees.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c4 Frozen Bourbon Cocktails for the Last (Official) Days of Summer.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a blender with 1 cup of ice.\n\nPour into a stemmed beer glass or Collins glass, and top with a heaping spoonful of orgeat-chantilly cream.\n\nGarnish with 3 fresh peach slices.\n\nServe with a straw.\n\n*Peach-infused bourbon: Wash and remove the skins and pits from 3 ripe peaches and cut peaches into large segments. Pour 750 mL bottle of bourbon into a plastic container, add peaches and let rest at room temperature for 24 to 48 hours. (The longer the better, but peach flavor extraction will cease after 48 hours.) Strain out solids through a cheesecloth and store in refrigerator for up to several weeks.\n\n**Orgeat-chantilly cream: Combine 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 cup Giffard orgeat in a bowl or stand mixer. Whip with a whisk or use a hand beater until stiff peaks form.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/0-L3WTLNHxymXGMeS3m6yVlb5kA=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__09__03145451__Haileys-Coment-720x720-recipe-72a34fd25cc342d69729523e8c267863.jpg", "authorName": "Hailey Coder", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
