The milk chocolate elixir plays off both of those so well, and the ginger snap liqueur and honey add a touch of sweetness.\u201d\n\nSteep all the ingredients except for the dried fruit in 6 oz hot water for 4 minutes to make a tea.\n\nAdd the dried apples, apricots and strawberries in a cup.\n\nPour the tea over the fruit.\n\n*Honey syrup: Add 1 cup honey and .5 cup water to a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until blended. Strain into a jar and seal tightly with a lid. Will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator.\n\n**Dried fruit mix: approximately 2 apples, 2 apricots and 5 strawberries.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/8McZbBrs5sapg3ZAUpBKNbR7DCc=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2017__02__08111948__nolet_steepydevoted_main_720x720-6d6bd90e672f4a9ab02eeb715b019193.png", "authorName": "Liquor.com", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
