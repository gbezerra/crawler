He steeps Hamilton Jamaican gold rum with golden raisins, orange peels, vanilla bean, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and other spices. Shaken with Maison rouge cognac, lemon, lime and grapefruit juices, the drink gains yet more spice from a float of Angostura bitters. A half-lime garnish filled with Green Chartreuse and a sugar cube is then lit tableside, caramelizing the sugar and releasing aromas of citrus, herbs and spice.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201c10 Rum Cocktails to Drink in Bars Now.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients except the bitters and Chartreuse into a shaker with ice and shake.\n\nStrain into a highball glass over crushed ice.\n\nFloat the bitters over top to fill.\n\nJuice half a lime and place lime on top of drink to garnish.\n\nPour the Chartreuse into the lime.\n\nPlace a sugar cube in the lime and light with a match or lighter to flame.\n\nServe with a straw.\n\n*Infused rum: In a 750 mL bottle of Hamilton Jamaican gold rum or El Dorado five-year-old rum, steep 1/4 cup golden raisins, 1 vanilla bean (scraped out), 1 tbsp cloves, 1 whole cinnamon stick, 3 crushed cardamom pods and 1 tbsp allspice berries for 48 hours, then strain.
