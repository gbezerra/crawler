Using Salers instead of the Lillet in a Vesper lends a spicy note, while vodka gives textural richness that offsets gin, which can be astringent and lean. \u201cBy using a grain spirit that has more viscosity, it coats the palate, leaving behind a lingering finish instead of a quick, dry one,\u201d says Johnson.\n\nThis recipe originally appeared as part of \u201cUse Vodka to Boost the Flavor and Body of Your Cocktails. This Is How You Do It.\u201d\n\nAdd all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.\n\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\n\nGarnish with a skewered brandied cherry and half-moon lemon peel.", "imageURL": "https://www.liquor.com/thmb/H_JQ7JhepqaEKTO-wxDoVdnW-mw=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__07__08121015__night-flights-720x720-recipe-a5419679ca84443aad7fca7719246822.jpg", "authorName": "Andra Johnson", "reviewCount": null, "avgRating": null}
